# UAL for Scatter Authenticator

This authenticator is meant to be used with [Scatter](https://get-scatter.com/) and [Universal Authenticator Library](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library). When used in combination with them, it gives developers the ability to request transaction signatures through Scatter using the common UAL API.
